# Welcome to Sandbox!

### The Sandbox is a unique concept which culminated in the minds of some of the best researchers and teachers, renowned worldwide for their contribution to academia, and realised with their efforts, ably aided by a well-qualified team of faculty coordinators and student members. If innovation makes you tick, if wanting to make a change in the society with your engineering skills is your dream, then Sandbox provides you with the perfect platform for it. Well-equipped with industry-standard facilities like 3-D printers, PCB Maker, Laser Cutter, Plasma Cutter, Titan XP and various other facilities, the lab provides BITS Pilaniâ€™s students with a conducive environment to work upon the next world- changing idea.

### The best project ideas, practical enough to be incorporated into the industry and with the potential to make a difference are chosen through a selection procedure and the student teams get 24*7 access to the lab facility to make their ideas a reality. Set up with the aim to provide the best resources, to bridge the gap between academia and industry and to foster real- time problem-solving skills and learning in our students the Sandbox has seen it all - successful projects, many of which can turn into promising startups. Like Elon Musk says, You can either watch it happen or be part of it. Come be a part of the Sandbox, come make a difference!
